# Cinemania

Cinemania is a web application for browsing movies. It allows users to discover popular movies, search for specific titles, and manage their own library of watched films. This project seems to utilize Google's Generative AI for some features.

## Development

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as a build tool.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm

### Installation and Running

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cinemania.git
    cd cinemania
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
- `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally for preview.
- `npm run deploy`: Deploys the application to GitHub Pages.

## Mobile-First Approach

The project should be developed with a mobile-first responsive design methodology.
